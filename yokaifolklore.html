            <h2>What is Folklore?</h2><br>
            <p>Folklore is our cultural DNA. It includes the art, stories, knowledge, and practices of a people. While folklore can be bound up in memory and histories, folklore is also tied to vibrant living traditions and creative expression today.
<br><br>
In the United States at least, we often think about “folklore” as something untrue (“Oh, that’s just folklore!”) or something old fashioned that’s no longer a regular part of everyday life (“nobody does that stuff anymore”). 
<br><br>
But if you think about it a little differently, folklore is and does so much more!
<br><br>
From the perspectives of the people who study folklore and partner with communities to present and preserve it, folklore is one of the many ways we communicate who we are. Often–but certainly not always–rooted in the  past, folklore is one of the ways we share with each other the things we see as vital and important. It is a central, every-day part of life and how we make sense of the world today, and it is at the heart of all cultures–including whatever culture we call our own–throughout the world. Folklore is a fundamental part of what it means to be human.
<br><br>
Folklore covers a wide range of topics, including issues in the news, such as fake news, cryptozoology, legends, holidays, internet memes, traditional and world music, and the supernatural. Folklorists are active in all areas of our society, studying topics such as education, healthcare, poverty, and immigration.
<br><br>
In Japan their folklore typically centers around Yōkai. This is because they not only explain supernatural experiences for them, but also unexplained inconivences.

        <h2>Different forms of Folklore</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div class="box">FOLK SONGS
             <br><br> <span class="popuptext">Folk music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from the former during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music that is played on traditional instruments, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between generations (folk process), music associated with a people's folklore, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.</span></div>
    <div class="box">FOLKS TALES
             <br><br> <span class="popuptext">Folktales are stories in the oral tradition, or tales that people tell each other out loud, rather than stories in written form. They're closely related to many storytelling traditions, including fables, myths, and fairy tales. Every human society has its own folktales; these well-known stories, handed down between generations, are an important way of passing along knowledge, information, and history.</span></div>
    <div class="box">FAIRY TALES        <br><br> <span class="popuptext">A fairy tale, fairytale, wonder tale, magic tale, fairy story or Märchen is an instance of European folklore genre that takes the form of a short story. Such stories typically feature mythical entities such as dwarfs, dragons, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, mermaids, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. In most cultures, there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described)and explicit moral tales, including beast fables.

    <div class="box">TALL TALES
         <br><br> <span class="popuptext">A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some tall tales are exaggerations of actual events, for example fish stories ("the fish that got away") such as, "That fish was so big, why I tell ya', it nearly sank the boat when I pulled it in!" Other tall tales are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the European countryside, the American frontier, the Canadian Northwest, the Australian frontier, or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.</span></div>
    <div class="box">BALLADS
                 <br><br> <span class="popuptext">A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual.

    <div class="box">PROVERBS
                 <br><br> <span class="popuptext">A proverb (from Latin: proverbium) is a simple and insightful, traditional saying that expresses a perceived truth based on common sense or experience. Proverbs are often metaphorical and use formulaic language. Collectively, they form a genre of folklore.

Some proverbs exist in more than one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures with which they are in contact. In the West, the Bible (including, but not limited to the Book of Proverbs) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of Erasmus) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent: one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the major spiritual book contain "between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible," whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, 11 are from the Bible. However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.</span></div>
