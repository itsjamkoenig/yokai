            <h2>What Are Yōkai?</h2><br>
            <p>Yōkai, 妖怪, are strange, supernatural creatures and phenomena from Japanese folklore. The word is a combination of the characters 妖 (yō–attractive, bewitching, calamity) and 怪 (kai–mystery, wonder).
                <br><br>
            Over the years, many different English words have been used as translations. Yōkai can be translated as monster, demon, spirit, or goblin, but it encompasses all of that and more. The world of yōkai also includes ghosts, gods, transformed humans and animals, spirit possession, urban legends, and other strange phenomena. It is a broad and vague term, and nothing exists in the English language that quite describes it. Yōkai is one of those words–like samurai, geisha, ninja, and sushi–that is best left in its native tongue.
                <br><br>
            One of the most difficult things to define are the boundaries of what constitutes a yōkai, and what isn’t a yōkai. Even in Japanese, the term is difficult to pin down. Over the many eras of Japan’s history, different words have been used as catch-all terms for the supernatural forces of this world; bakemono, obake, mononoke, kaii, oni. Depending on who you’re talking to, specific creatures may or may not be classified as yokai. Are ghosts yōkai? Are oni yōkai? Can good spirits be yōkai or are they only evil spirits? Are kami yōkai? Does yōkai only apply to Japan, or does it apply to all countries? Every rule has an exception, and every answer has a contradiction.
                <br><br>
            The broadest possible definition of yōkai includes all supernatural creatures and phenomena from all parts of the world. Essentially, everything supernatural everywhere. I prefer to use a broad brush when defining yōkai, but not that broad. In my books and on this site, yōkai refers to all supernatural creatures and phenomena which are found in Japanese folklore. My definition is limited specifically to Japanese folklore for two reasons: because yōkai is a Japanese word, and because there already is an English word which describes everything supernatural from everywhere–supernatural. But aside from restricting the definition to Japanese folklore, I prefer to define yōkai with as broad a brush as possible.</p>

            <h2>A Brief History on Yokai</h2><br>
            Japanese folklore is an amalgamation of different traditions, with its foundation in the folk religions of isolated tribes living on the Japanese isles. These traditions were modified by Shintō and later Buddhism, incorporating elements from Chinese and Indian folklore and mythology as well.
                <br><br>
            The oldest recorded histories of Japan go back to the 8th century and contain the creation myths and legendary prehistory of Japan. Various documents catalog these stories from different perspectives, and contain the earliest records of the gods, demons, and other supernatural creatures of Japanese folklore; the earliest forms of Yōkai storytelling were truly folkloric in nature. They were short stories passed through word of mouth from generation to generation and exchanged across regions. The stories served as entertainment as well as legends that typified specific regions and local belief systems of Japan. As modern technologies such as the printing press were created, the stories of Yōkai were even further distributed across Japan's various tribal-kingdoms. 
                <br><br>
            In ancient Japan, spirits were thought to be formless and invisible to the human eye. However, as artistic traditions developed, it became necessary to visually depict the spirits and monsters from stories. These began as painted scrolls, and later expanded into multi-volume illustrated encyclopedias of strange tales and supernatural stories.

          <h3>EDO PERIOD</h3>
          <p>An unprecedented flourishing of culture and art in Japan. Ghost stories and stories about monsters and strange phenomena from the all over Japan experienced a huge surge in popularity. The very first mythical bestiaries were put together by folklorists and artists like Toriyama Sekien, who collected the oral traditions of rural Japan for consumption by the growing urban population (and added a few original monsters into the mix). Sekien’s yōkai encyclopedias set the stage for other artists, and a new tradition was born. It quickly expanded into every aspect of Japanese culture, from fine art to high theater, from aristocratic ghost story-telling parties to low class bawdlery.</p>

          <h3>TORIYAMA SEKIEN</h3>
          <p>One of the most popular folklorists of this time who also kept a collection of Yōkai stories as he traveled throughout Japan. Seiken's collection was special in that it cataloged each Yōkai with an image and story that he created or originated from traditional Japanese folklore and Chinese literature. Seiken is credited with drawing over 200 Yōkai and creating a method of compiling Yōkai  as a physical art form to be shared verbally.</p>

          <h3>MEIJI PERIOD</h3>
          <p>The most turbulent times for Japanese folklore in that Yōkai storytelling was almost completely eradicated. As Japan was westernized and swept into a wave of modernization. A cultural shift away from its historical benevolence for the supernatural and instead Japan pursued scientific and rationalist logic. There was an academic effort led by Inoue Enryō to scientifically address each known story of the Yōkai and dispel its significance with science and logic. Ironically enough, Inoue created one of the largest collections of Yōkai descriptions and narratives from all over the country. As the government of Japan grew and became more militarized, the traditional Yōkai beliefs were seen as superstitious and troublesome.  By WWII, Yōkai was almost lost within Japanese culture with remnants of the storytelling only among more remote populations.</p>

          <h3>PRESENT DAY</h3>
          <p>Cultural attitudes changed around Yōkai once again. Instead of viewing Yōkai as a meaningless superstition, academics such as Yanagita Kunio (1875-1962) began to study Yōkai as Japanese folklore. He began to collect stories, art, and narratives of Yōkai as a means to better understand the lives of Japanese people in different regional areas. He recognized that Yōkai provide a portal into the soul of local Japanese cultures. Through the study of Yōkai, Kunio could learn the values, fears, and varying depths of imagination of Japan's various regions and their cultures. As Yōkai became popular in the academic setting, it soon became popular in the entertainment setting as well. Manga artists like Mizuki Shigeru (1922-2015) created popular series that heavily incorporated  Yōkai narratives into his work. As the popularity of Yōkai has spread, the monsters of Yōkai can now be seen in manga, anime, filmed works, as well as video games.</p>
