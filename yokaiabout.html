            <h2>About This Site</h2><br>
            <p>This site is written, illustrated, and maintained by Jamie Koenig. It is created to showcase the interesting subject of Japanese folklore, better known as Yōkai.
                <br><br>
            This web site began as a booklet project for a typography class, in which I illustrted and introduced ten yōkai in three seperate booklets. I kept the same subject matter but decided to expand it into a horror-esque website, dealing with primarily red, black, and white as the main colors.
                <br><br>
            This website is intended as an introduction to the supernatural creatures and phenomena of Japanese folklore known as yōkai. It is not the final authority on any particular yōkai or yōkai in general. It is not an all-inclusive or exhaustive collection. There are far more stories and descriptions for each yōkai than could ever fit on these small pages. It will never be able to cover all of the yōkai that have ever been thought up.
                <br><br>
            This site deals primarily with folklore, not mythology. Folklore is full of contradictions. Unlike mythology, there is no fixed canon or final authority on what is or isn’t. Folklore belongs to everyone. Many entries on this site have multiple explanations which contradict each other. Their definitions have changed over time, and will continue to change for as long as their stories are told. This uncertainty–the inability to know–that is inherent in folklore can be frustrating. However, it is one of the primary points of enjoyment in yōkai lore. To fully comprehend yōkai is impossible; indeed it goes against their very nature. The essence of yōkai is that they are ultimately mysterious and unknowable.
                <br><br>
            You will notice a lack of inline citations on each entry. This is on purpose. Although great care is taken to ensure that yōkai are accurately researched from original sources and actual folklore (as opposed to fakelore), this website is not intended as an academic research project. It is meant for the enjoyment sand appreciation of yōkai, free from the pretense of being authoritative or canonical. That said, citations and sources can be provided upon request for any particular entry.</p></div>
